## Acccount 
Is a place where we can record, sort and store all transactions that affect a related group of items.
A *T-Account* is a visual representation of an Account.

| Debit | Credit |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Dividends | Liabilities |
| Expenses | Owners Equity |
| Assets | Revenue |

LHS increase when debited, decreased when credited

so cash (assets) looks like this

| Debit | Credit |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Opening Bal |  |
|  | Bill Payment |
|  | New Supplies |
| Closing Bal |  |

Balance => total at point in time e.g. Opening, Closing


## Accural method of Accounting
Revenue is recognised as it's earned. Expenses are recorded as they are included.

## Posting 
Manual Journal entry -> post directly to general ledger, skip past sub ledgers
Automatic Journal entry -> you pay an invoice. Entry in Cash and AP accounts. Totals for these accounts trigger corresponding accountss in General Ledger to be updated.

## Accounts Payable
This is a control account held in General Ledger. Shows the balance.
Look at the Accounts Payable *Subledger* for details.
Totals have to match between the two.
